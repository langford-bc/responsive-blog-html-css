                    <h2>Why we built Perfood Labs</h2>
                    <h4 class="article-author">by Dominik Burziwoda</h4>
              <script type="IN/Share" data-url="https://www.linkedin.com"></script>
                    <p>In 2017, Perfood was founded out of a grant-funded project at the University of Lübeck in Germany. When we founded the company, we had 25,000 Euros in the bank which came from our founding team’s savings - and honestly, we didn’t really have much more than that. Our intention was to build digital therapeutics powered by personalized low-glycemic diet. Some people thought it was crazy, some loved it.</p>
                    <p>There was no other company in the world doing it and there was no playbook. To get the business going, our main goal was to learn as much as possible about what our product could look like and what the stumbling blocks could be. We needed real-world user data.</p>
                    <p>Back then, food manufacturers heard about us and wanted to learn more about the impact of their products on personalized glycemic reactions.  </p>
                    <p>To quote one executive, “You are telling us where the risks and opportunities are within our product portfolio in a world of personalized nutrition, which we all believe it’s going to come to.” With this we found our starting value proposition. After, we acquired industry partnerships to conduct real-world studies.</p>
                    <p>Food manufacturers paid us for these studies while we were developing our app. Users received our newly created app, MillionFriends at an attractive discount. This system, and a bit of Angel funding kept us going for three years until we raised a larger financing round from venture capital funds.</p>
                    <p>The reaction to what we were developing gave us a sense that what we were working on was relevant. Food manufacturers were surprised to see that some of their products - which were suspected to provoke a severe glycemic reaction - were on average pretty good and that fit the needs of some consumers with very moderate glycemic elevations.</p>
                    <p>Using insights from us, food companies were then able to compare different formulations and survey users about appeal, packaging, and product attractiveness.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, people were excited to use our app and continuous glucose monitors while testing a couple of free food samples. For us, it was a great option to co-finance the development of our MillionFriends program and our digital therapeutics products.</p>
                    <p>Then, in early 2020, Sars-CoV-2 hit Germany. I myself was among the earliest cases. German health authorities forced me to track my symptoms daily to decide on the duration of my quarantine. Picturing the potentially zillions of paper-diaries being sent to the health authorities’ offices worsened my Covid-19 symptoms. In our MillionFriends app, we had great tracking features and I quickly asked our software development team to add Covid-19 tracking functionality. At the same time, an epidemiological study was planned at the University of Lübeck. It only made sense to gather data with our newly released Covid-19 tracker. A few weeks later, one of the largest epidemiological studies was being carried out using our app.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, we started adding clinical trials at Perfood in partnership with research consortia. Running numerous studies at the same time, limited our ability to flexibly change and add features to MillionFriends. As a result, we decided to launch a dedicated app for running clinical trials. We launched this app in May, and it’s called Perfood Labs.</p>
                    <p>We are incredibly excited about it since we already have many projects scheduled this year for PCOS, Celiac disease, Colon Cancer and Osteoarthritis. Today, research partners approach us to use the technology in their studies. It’s been a great win-win for all of us as the app not only provides flexible functionality, but also the ability to remind patients and increase compliance as well as to collect data remotely and sync it with lab results.</p>
                    <p>With Perfood-Labs we are now bringing these projects to a new level by offering our research partners a flexible platform, as well as developing our pipeline of digital biomarkers and digital therapeutics. Exciting times ahead!</p>
